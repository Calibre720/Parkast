This is a SmartParking app. This app uses the module functionality from the Meteor 1.3, but everything else should be applicable to Meteor 1.2 as well.

The backend and frontend have been made using the Meteor implementation of javascript

### Running the server
--> Install Meteor - https://www.meteor.com/install for your platform
--> After installing Meteor
--> Go to your terminal
--> Change the working directory in the terminal to Parkast
--> Give command --> meteor
Meteor will install all dependencies on its own
and start the app.

Now the app can be accessed from any browser which can connect with proxy disabled
your_ip_addresss:3000
localhost:3000

-->The default port on which the server starts is 3000, refer to your meteor installation for changing the port
This page will be hosted on instituted local network for which proxy has to be disabled
